# DESCRIPTION
*simplemail* send an email to the address specified in *TO*, with the subject specified in *SUBJECT* and the content specified in *CONTENT*. Running *simplemail* for the first time causes the program to ask for the mail informations.

*TO* can be specified as a simple parameter (e.g mail@mail.com) or as a string with angle brackets (e.g "<mail@mail.com>"). As a result, it is possible to send the mail to several addresses (e.g "<mail@mail.com><mail@mail.org>").
